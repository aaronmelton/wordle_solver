# TODO

1. Create a GUI front-end to improve use.
2. Remove logging; Does anyone else actually care about this?
3. Add a function to generate words not in the list of possibilities but not reusing any already-used words?
4. Order words in list based on statistical letter distribution (most common letters in English)?
5. Reduce Docker Image size (307MB!?)
