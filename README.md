# Wordle Solver

A Python script that produces a list of possible words based on results from playing Wordle.

## Getting Started

### About This Code
I wrote this script to gain some experience working with Pandas Data Frames.  And give me an extra edge competing with family/friends for the best Wordle score. :)

### Prerequisites
* You'll need to plug the results of your game play into the script.
* Set environment variables (see config.py).

#### Python Libraries
* See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
* Only pandas is required to run the script; All others are for testing code.

### Instructions For Use

* `python wordle_solver.py`
